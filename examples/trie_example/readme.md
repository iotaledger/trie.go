Execute `go run .` to run the trie_example.

In this example we use as a commitment model based on blake2b with HashZize(160), with arity 2.

We demonstrate a commitment of values and partial removal of these. Root commitments are calculated. Retrieve proof for Proof of Inclusion (PoI) and verify if proof is in the state.
