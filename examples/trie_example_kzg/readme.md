Execute `go run .` to run the trie_example.

In this example we use as a commitment model based on KZG (Kate) polynomial commitments with bn256 curve, with arity 256.

We demonstrate a commitment of values and partial removal of these. Root commitments are calculated. Retrieve proof for Proof of Inclusion (PoI) and verify if proof is in the state.
